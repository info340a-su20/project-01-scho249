    <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

    <h4>What is a bucket list? Why matter?</h4>
    <img src= "img/bucketlist.jpg" alt="bucketlist icon" class="center">
    <p>A bucket list, by definition, is a list of all the activities or experiences 
        that people have never done but want to obtain before dying. With the word 
        "dying", it may sound like the list should contain activities that are grandiose 
        and impressive, but one can start the list with something very small: riding on a 
        hot air balloon, achieving the ideal weight, etc. The only thing that matters 
        with creating a bucket list is to explore things that can impress or have 
        meanings to oneself. In day-to-day life, people are going through a lot of 
        stress either from their home, school, job, etc. and being too busy with their 
        daily tasks, people don't get to devote much time for themselves thinking about 
        what they are interested in and what things could bring joy. The problem that I want 
        to focus more with this topic is that the private space on the web for the user to 
        create their list is lacking. Since bucket lists are rather personal, I seek to 
        create a place where the privacy of the users is assured and people feel secure 
        to make a list of their private wishes or dreams.
    </p>
        <br>These are some existing websites that address the problem area: 
         <ul>
            <li>
                <cite><a href="https://bucketlist.org/">bucketlist.org</a>
                : this site comprises over 5 million ideas for bucket list that people can refer to.
            </li>
            <li>
                <cite><a href="https://www.bucketlist.net/">bucketlist.net</a>
                    : this site has both list of ideas and place where user can create their list. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Although these websites are a great resources in regards to bucket lists,
        I thought these websites are more focused on giving information rahter than 
        letting the users to track their own list. The second website does have a 
        place where the user can make their own list, it only seemed to consider somewhat 
        big goals. In my web app, I will also consider small dreams that people 
        want to achieve in their daily and the details of achieving the 
        list like budget and time.

        <h2>Web App Description</h2>
        <p>
            Nowadays, we follow a lot of routine tasks in our home, work, or school that 
            after we finish one task, the next task is awaiting. Because of this, we are 
            so used to getting orders and following orders. This is a problem because whenever we are
            given the opportunity to think of anything we want to do right now, we most often can't come 
            up with one right away. However, everyone has some things that they want to achieve, the dreams; 
            it's just that they are pushed behind of reality. Especially nowadays where we are restricted so many outdoor activities,
             people must have things that they want to do after when things get back to normal. But that can be easily forgotten if 
             we don't list them down. Not just listing down, we want to actually move closer to achieve those goals by having solid plans. Hence, 
             my web app will have features that allow users to list down what they want to achieve in their lifetime and make solid plans. 
             By just having the things they want written down, people will be motivated as they refer back. 
        </p>

        <p>   
            So, the users of my web app are basically everyone that is seeking for 
            motivations in their life. The app will be somewhat similar to task managing
             apps by having a calendar that the user can enter in the list they want 
             to achieve daily, monthly, also with a space to create a bigger list of 
             activities they want to achieve in their lifetime. Having a list entered in,
              the user will be able to specify budget and time such as how much they need 
              o achieve their goals or when they want to achieve by. The user will also be 
              able to find out ideas that others for reference and share their ideas if 
              they choose to. 
        </p>  
            List of features include:
            <ul>
                <li>Calendar tab that lets the user to enter in goals for a day, month, year</li>
                <li>Bucket list tab that user want to achieve in their lifetime</li>
                <li>Crossing out of activities that are achieved; there will be separate space to see achievements</li>
                <li>Information tab with bucket list ideas that other users choose to share</li>
                <li>Budget and time tracker</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Hence, my web app will focus on providing space for the user to make a list of their dreams, hopes, and aspirations 
            and have a basic plan for those to maximize the experiences in their life. By using this app, 
            the users will be given a refreshing time to find out what they really want in their 
            lifetime and get a motivation to move forward which will in turn give time to alleviate their stress.
